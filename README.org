This repository contains a template for my PhD thesis at Saarland University.

The [[file:thesis.pdf][template]] demonstrates the most important features and looks. You can find a full thesis example [[https://dx.doi.org/10.22028/D291-45256][here]].

This is a fork from the thesis template by Felix Dangel, which you can find [[https://github.com/f-dangel/phd-thesis-template][here]]. 
While I have adapted some commands and style choices, the content shown in the example is almost exclusively that from Felix's repository.
Please go check his template in case you prefer Felix's style better.
